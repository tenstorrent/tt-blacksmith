# NeRF Experiment

This directory contains the code for the NeRF experiment.
Original paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00878).
Experiment from this directory has a minor difference from original paper; instead of using a threshold to determine important voxels, "top k" method is used.
This ensures robustness across different datasets and is more compatible with JAX framework.

## Overview

The NeRF experiment is an implementation of the EfficientNeRF algorithm for 3D reconstruction from 2D images.
The experiment is designed to run in the JAX framework.

## Training

```bash
python3 blacksmith/experiments/jax/nerf/test_nerf.py
```

## Data

The experiment uses the Blender dataset, which is a synthetic dataset of 3D objects.
It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nguyenhung1903/nerf-synthetic-dataset).

The dataset should follow the following structure:

```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── r_0.png
│   ├── r_1.png
│   └── ...
├── test/
│   ├── r_0.png
│   ├── r_1.png
│   └── ...
├── transforms_train.json
└── transforms_test.json
```

The `transforms_train.json` and `transforms_test.json` files contain the camera parameters for the images in the dataset.
Check the dataset documentation mentioned above for more information.


## Configuration

The experiment is configured using the configuration file `test_nerf.yaml`. The configuration file specifies the hyperparameters for the experiment, such as the number of epochs, the batch size, and the learning rate.

Current `test_nerf.yaml` has the recommended and tested hyperparameters for the experiment.
