# tt-blacksmith

The **tt-blacksmith** project contains optimized training recipes for a variety of machine learning models on [Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/) hardware, powered by the [TT-Forge](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge) compiler stack. Showcasing the compiler's flexibility, it enables the use of popular [AI frameworks](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge?tab=readme-ov-file#current-ai-framework-front-end-projects) like PyTorch and JAX for training workflows.

For more information on the project, see our [documentation](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tt-blacksmith/).
